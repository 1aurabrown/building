This spring Are.na launched an [equity crowdfunding campaign](https://republic.co/arena) to build a foundation for the future of the platform, and we’re proud to say we raised over $270,000 in the process. 

We’re even more excited that existing Are.na members invested over 70% of the total. In equity terms, that means 600+ members now collectively hold the equivalent of about 4% of Are.na’s valuation. We see this as a vital connection between our member’s interests and our aspirations as an ethical business.

We’re using the capital we raised this spring to take a few crucial steps forward. In the next few months we’ll be hiring another developer to modernize the infrastructure of the platform. This fall we’ll release important new features and admin tools for teams. We’re also onboarding a set of business clients we’re proud to call customers. Thanks to our member-investors, Are.na is becoming a better tool for all kinds of groups to think more creatively and work more mindfully.  

We believe that anyone can benefit from cultivating knowledge together on Are.na. As we work to popularize a more human experience of the web, we’ll be listening closely to our dedicated members and working hard to strengthen the relationships that make Are.na feel personal. We’re committed to growing this ecology of ideas together, with you.

We're still a small team, but we try to be available as much as we can. If you have ideas for how Are.na could work better, or if you just want to talk to us, please send us an email ([info@are.na](mailto:info@are.na)). Good ideas don’t emerge from a void. We are always striving to learn from what came before us and stay open to new ideas as they emerge. We hope Are.na helps you do the same.
