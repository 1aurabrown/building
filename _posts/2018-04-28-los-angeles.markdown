_A Collection of Channels is a series highlighting channels we’re paying attention to on Are.na._

How to know a place as large as L.A. County, five thousand square miles and population eleven million, if not through triangulation? Not even New York receives the amount of block- and channel-angst on Are.na that Los Angeles does. Something about the city's simultaneous utopian and dystopian affects inspires hardlines; something about the city's sprawling size and connected microcultures gives off a sense of unknowability. When summed up, it is only through contradictions, an attempt to make opposing terms capture a thing in the space between them. "The L.A. vibe is wrinkles caulked with make-up, fading high-budget marketing for something no one saw, no one bought, black SUVs gliding away from a distant sound of gunshots, the cookout smell of roasting corn, a sixteen-year-old vomiting on gleaming travertine," [one block](https://www.are.na/block/1803222) reads.

"In L.A. you have the power to determine when you're seen by others and when you go dark, and how intimate the settings are when you make an appearance... Moving to L.A. isn't about disappearing — it's about modulating between 'being there' and 'ghosting.'" ([K-Hole #5](https://www.are.na/block/817162), collected in Lukas W’s “LA Phenomenology”)
