We introduced Premium membership two years ago to give users access to better features and help support Are.na as it grew. This summer we finally got the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to Are.na full-time. As a result, we are able to take bigger steps towards improving Are.na while ensuring that it remains open to everyone.

One of those steps is re-evaluating the way our Premium membership works. We believe Are.na’s pricing structure should reflect the value the Are.na community creates. The contributions and connections people make in public are shared benefits, and allow the community to thrive. For that reason, we are shifting to a model where Premium members pay for privacy rather than extra features. 

### How are the plans changing?

Starting on August 23, 2017, free accounts will have access to all tool and features, including those previously available only to Premium members. However, free accounts will be limited to a total of 100 total private blocks of content. 

Premium members will be able to add unlimited private content, and will also get early access to new products while they are still in development, including the Are.na mobile app. The price of Premium accounts will stay the same: $5 per month or $45 per year.

We know many of you are longtime users who have gone out of your way to support and advocate for Are.na. As we move forward, we will be transparent about our process and continue to look to you to help us determine the future of the platform. 

### Did you say Are.na mobile app?

Yes. We’re very excited to announce that we will be releasing an Are.na mobile app early this fall. Premium members will have access to an early beta version of the app starting August 21. Moving forward, we will look to your feedback to help us shape the way the app functions, looks, and feels. Stay tuned for updates.

Finally, I want to thank you for your support and enthusiasm. Are.na is a community of shared knowledge; we are nothing without you.
