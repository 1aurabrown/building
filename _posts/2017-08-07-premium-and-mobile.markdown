After working on Are.na as a team for more than three years, we finally got the opportunity this summer to dedicate ourselves to Are.na full-time. In the coming months, we’ll be taking big steps towards improving Are.na while ensuring that it remains open to everyone. 

## New Pricing

One of those steps is re-evaluating the way Premium membership works. We believe our pricing should reflect the value the Are.na community creates when it contributes and generates knowledge together. For that reason, we also believe selling your data or serving you ads is not the right way to support Are.na. That’s why we are shifting to a model where everyone has access to Are.na’s features and Premium members pay for privacy in order to use Are.na for professional or personal work. 

## How are the plans changing?

Starting on August 23, 2017, free accounts will have access to all tools and features, including those previously available only to Premium members. Everyone on Are.na will be able to create a custom bio, mute channels, search within channels, see channels in list view, and manage all channels in one place. However, free accounts will be limited to a total of 100 total private blocks of content. 

Premium members will be able to add unlimited private content. The price of Premium accounts will stay the same: $5 per month or $45 per year.

We know many of you are longtime users who have gone out of your way to support and advocate for Are.na. As we move forward, we will be transparent about our process and continue looking to you to help us determine the future of the platform. 

Finally, I want to thank you for your generosity and enthusiasm. Are.na is a community of shared knowledge, and we look forward to building it with you.
