[Erik Wysocan](http://erikwysocan.com/) and [Benjamin Tiven](http://www.benjamintiven.com/) are both artists and publishers in their own right. When they met at the start of 2015, they immediately began formulating an idea for a platform that supports the kinds of digital art publications they both participate in. That idea has since become [Library Stack](http://www.librarystack.org/), an archive for digital objects of all stripes—PDFs, video, online magazines, Soundcloud files. In the fall, they begin working with the Yale University Library to connect it to their growing collection, with more relationships with university libraries to come.

Interacting with Library Stack as a reader, it feels like a place of deep discoverability—it’s main purpose to collect and preserve materials on the internet worth collecting and preserving. It is that, and it is also much more. Erik and Ben have put a lot of thought into the traditional licensing models for digital objects–Amazon/Kindle, Apple/iTunes, Barnes And Noble/Nook—and how they short change both libraries and independent publishers. Library Stack offers an alternative method for introducing libraries to artist publications, for acquisition into their collection, and art publications to libraries, so they can be catalogued for the future. It is also becoming a database that allows for libraries to connect to each other and to independent presses, completely outside of and unreliant on the traditional publishing paradigm.

Over Skype last month, I asked Ben and Erik to break down what they are doing on a technical level, and to take me through the many interconnected facets of their platform and how it is creating space for the kinds of publishers they want to see more of.

**Meg Miller: Why did you start Library Stack? How did the idea come about?**

Erik Wysocan: It’s a spin off of my publishing imprint [Halmos](http://www.halmos.us.com/). I was doing a lot of digital publishing and was learning the advantages and the pitfalls of engaging with licensing models like Amazon and iTunes, which give you, potentially, a really wide audience, but are also very restrictive about how they allow you to operate. 
 
The problem I was running into with libraries specifically was that they weren’t able to access our content, nor were they even aware of it. We were having trouble putting our books into the [WorldCat database](https://www.worldcat.org/), so I realized that as far as the library is concerned there is a giant black hole of books being published that they can’t easily see because they aren’t in their databases. There’s a widening gap between the publishing world and the lending world. 
 
So Library Stack just started as a side project, or a technological solution to this problem—just to get content at least listed on the WorldCat database. I don’t know if you’re familiar with WorldCat, it’s basically a global database that all the libraries share. 

**I know what it is but I don’t know, as an independent publisher, how you get your books on there. I would be interested to know.**

EW: They don’t make it super easy. WorldCat is pretty technology-forward and they’re geared toward servicing small independent libraries who catalog their content and want to have it in their system for researchers. So they have an API. 
 
I was digging around on it and I realized that they offered these services, and I realized that it wouldn’t be that hard to at least get my own books on there using their interface. While I was at it, it became clear that there was a need for this for a lot of art publishers who are not publishing through the traditional vendor system. So I started cataloging a lot of titles that were on these platforms like Amazon, and just trying to make sure that they were visible to library researchers. 
 
I started getting contacted by art librarians who were way more aware of these issues than I was at the time. They started asking me about what I was doing, and at the time I didn’t really know what I was doing. I was just sort of playing around. But it eventually snowballed into Library Stack. I met Ben and he had a larger vision of what it could be beyond a hobby project. He helped me figure out how it could be an actual service for libraries that is integrated with their systems.

**Ben, what is your background?**

Ben Tiven: I make mostly film and video projects. I’ve also done a lot of writing and book projects. When I first met Erik and we started talking about this, which was maybe the beginning of 2015, I just recognized in it something very resonant to what I was interested in. 
 
There was a lot of discussion last summer about the different ways Library Stack can grow. Originally, it was a resource for artists, and it still is at its heart. We still look to artists to learn something from the publishing landscape and also to have their work cataloged in this proper metadata way where the world system can take note of it. But in terms of other things the service could do, eventually we realized that we could reach out to libraries, and we had accidentally stumbled into doing something that institutional libraries needed done. That’s how we got together. 

**I read Erik’s piece on the [ARLIS blog](https://arlisnacdsig.wordpress.com/2016/01/05/on-the-need-for-a-digital-library-of-arts-erik-wysocan/), which went into that a bit, and I was excited to see that you both are thinking about Library Stack as an alternative to traditional e-book licensing models like Amazon’s for Kindle or Apple’s for iBook. Those are closed circuit formats that are protected and proprietary to those companies, to ensure that you can only read the material on their devices. Can you talk about why these models don’t work well for libraries?**

EW: There was a more conceptual shift that occurred with the invention of iTunes where media started becoming licensed content rather than something you would buy at the store and own. So there was a very fundamental way of reconceiving the media itself that basically meant that there was no such idea, on a deep level, of owning the content. It doesn’t have that big of an effect on a consumer, who is just buying an e-book or digital file and it sits in their online library. But for a library to deal with that is much more complicated. All these licenses are a one-to-one correspondence for a consumer platform, but they’re not designed for lending or borrowing. So libraries get cut out of that circuit. 
 
There are some formats, like Kindle formats for instance, that are available to libraries, but they work on a subscription model. The libraries very rarely get to own the content—they are paying subscription fees to very large platform vendors that basically put a bunch of content in a bucket and the libraries subscribe to it. So they get what they get, and the work of smaller publishers isn’t usually included. And if they do find an interesting title that was made by an independent publisher, it’s very hard for them to acquire it if it’s not on one of these platforms. Regardless of this whole licensing regime, there’s just this intrinsic censorship that is biased toward large publishers. 

**So how does Library Stack approach that problem?**

EW: What we’re trying to do is explore how you get beyond that licensing model and get libraries back to their core role of providing researching tools and content long-term. Digital files can be difficult to track and it's easy to loose them in the ether. So we want libraries to be able to own them, and they have technologies for preserving them if they can get their hands on them.
 
BT: Library Stack is a slightly strange animal in that it’s doing a few things at one time. The big thing is it’s this publicly accessible database of publicly accessible things. The digital objects on Library Stack are almost always things that are already openly circulated online. We are creating bibliographic references to connect them and house them. Anyone can use the database, and anyone can use the tools that are being built into the database to sift through and to catalog and to search. That’s the main thing. 
 
There’s also a relationship to institutional libraries that we’re building. With them, we’re connecting the databases they use and making them speak to each other. We’re also making search functions universal and hosting lendable e-book content from smaller publishers. These might be publishers who don’t have or don’t want big platform distribution like Erik was describing. 
 
And then the third thing is that Library Stack is itself a publisher. We are also working on making our own digital objects and projects. We’ve only begun: The “programs” section on the site are the first few examples of one set of things that we’ll do. Guest critics or artists are invited to add materials to make a sub-collection or new collection of objects. We’re also making e-books, typically with people who are already in Library Stack.

**What is your process for acquiring the works on Library Stack? If you see a publication you want to have on the platform, how do you go about getting it and putting it into a format that is accessible for libraries?**

EW: Amazon and iTunes isn’t the entire world of digital publication. There are a lot of people who put stuff on Amazon but also release it for free on their own websites, or with Creative Commons licenses, or open source licenses. The bulk of our platform right now is artist-produced, independent-publisher-produced documents that are e-pubs or PDFs, or other media, but isn’t being catalogued in a rigorous way. 
 
We’re also starting to work with artists and publishers to get up the work they want protected, or they want to sell, so libraries can actually buy it. The hope is that we’re starting to develop new channels to support artist practices by giving them an independent distribution platform. 
 
BT: The other big thing that we’re paying attention to are publication series from quasi-official platforms. An easy example would be [e-flux journal](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/), which is a pretty rigorous, systematic monthly publication, but it is in a format that is not easily picked up in the context we’ve been talking about—by WorldCat for example. 
 
A lot of these initiatives come from contemporary art or design or cinema. And there’s a lot of overlapping context among them, so we’re trying to build a platform where they can be cross-referenced. 
 
It’s like a card catalog—there’s just a particular listing with everything about the object. And we’ve tried to be really conscientious about attributing every person who is listed as having a role in the production of some object. We’re listing authors and titles and publishers, but also translators, designers, someone who is listed as ‘editorial oversight’ all will get a credit. As you build out the database you might discover that the person who was in charge of editorial oversight for publication X also shows up as author or artist or guest editor for something else. So you can see how an artist moves through all these objects or publications.

**I was wondering how you guys were thinking about Library Stack, not just as a space for preservation, but also as a place to bring together small presses or the art publishing community in one spot. As a place of exchange and exposure to things that wouldn’t get made in traditional publishing?**

BT: Library Stack is creating a space that we hope more and more people and objects will come to fill. As there becomes more of a framework to post and index these objects, and get them recognized by the library system and so on, there will be more of a reason for artists to make these kinds of publications. 
 
EW: Given that the commercial gallery system is such a fraught and tenuous space right now, it’s important to develop these alternatives. I’ve always thought of publishing as an alternative distribution model. We’re trying to build up on that infrastructure and create new ways to foster art production.

**Erik, elsewhere you've talked about blockchain as one possible mode of distribution outside of the traditional market. I know the publisher [Visual Editions](http://visual-editions.com/a-universe-explodes-by-tea-uglow) has been experimenting with this. Can you talk about your research with this technology, and whether you envision blockchain becoming central to digital publishing in the near future?**

EW: That Universe Explodes project by Visual Editions is interesting. The idea that you can have a digital edition that disintegrates, or degrades, gets at the core of the central issue of what it means to have digital ownership. It’s very easy for a library to own a physical book because there is sort of an inherent wear imposed on the book that gives it a limited lifespan. It’s not infinite, so you can put a price tag on it. 
 
But a digital product functionally infinite, it can last for thousands of years—how can you put the value on that? You really lose the material basis for how to value things. The whole traditional sales model for publishers completely falls apart. People are really struggling with what to do in place of that, and they’ve been holding up traditional sales with these licensing models that have been really destructive for publishers and libraries. The only people who are winning are the distribution platforms. 
 
I’m not 100 percent sure blockchain is going to be the right solution or if it’s just a libertarian pipe dream. Maybe it is going in the wrong direction. But it is offering up these alternative ideas about ownership and property. For example, people are thinking through different ways of incentivizing non-piracy. The problem with any digital thing for a publisher that is worried about its sales is pirating. They want copy protection or DRM to protect the book from being pirated, which never works. So there’s been some discussion about using blockchain, and the pirate becomes the distributor. Maybe you embrace this position of piracy, and cut them in on the profits as well. So the pirate is compensated, the artist is compensated—everyone is compensated and the ledger keeps track on interaction.
