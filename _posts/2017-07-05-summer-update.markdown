These days, it’s commonplace to hear complaints about what the Internet is doing to our brains. Without naming names, "I hate _insert social media platform here_" is a phrase that I hear on a regular basis. I'm sure you experience more or less the same thing. As to why we find ourselves in this situation, it isn’t that complicated. If a social media platform's business model is built on advertising, it's in the company's best interest to make its platform as addictive as possible. The easiest way to make a content platform addictive is to encourage content that confirms people's pre-existing beliefs or plays on their insecurities and susceptibility to FOMO.

With Are.na, we are betting on the opposite direction. We think that people will (and do) want something else in an everyday online experience. Something that is healthy, as opposed to the junk food we automatically digest on a daily basis. In our opinion, any technology that encourages people to be lazy or worse humans will (or should) never be fashionable.
 
To grow Are.na without sacrificing that ethos, we needed to find someone who wanted to take that bet with us. A few months ago, I met up with [Chris Barley](https://www.are.na/christopher-barley). I knew Chris because he [Leo Shaw](https://www.are.na/leo-shaw), and [Christina Badal](https://www.are.na/christina-badal) (who work with Chris at [Consortia](http://consortia.net)) were already using Are.na in their own daily work, and we had developed a habit of meeting every month or so to catch up. I had recently gone down to part-time at my job as a software engineer at Artsy in order to spend more time working on Are.na, and Daniel Pianetti and I were at the beginning of exploring what getting investors would look like and what type of people would both share our philosophy and have the means and motivation to join us.
  
Chris turned out to be the person willing to take the bet. Now we’re in a position for the first time in three years to be able to work on Are.na full-time, without having to do other work on the side in order to survive. We have a lot planned for the next 6 months. I want to share some of our immediate plans, but I'm going to talk about some of the new team members and changes to our (still small) structure first.
 
### Focus + Team
A lot of people who use Are.na remark on how impressive the content is, and how interesting the users are—and of course we agree. In the same breath though, more often than not, people also ask about scale. How can we get bigger without the quality of the community getting diluted? It's a good question, and something we are more careful about than most things. The real answer is, we don't have any desire to be exclusive, but we don't want to grow Are.na just for the sake of getting bigger. We want to provide better alternatives for people to contextualize the information that is most relevant to them at any given time, and we want that alternative to be available to as many people as possible. Our challenge is to promote a culture of curiosity on the Internet. We believe that [Chris](https://www.are.na/christopher-barley) and [Consortia](https://www.are.na/consortia-systems) are natural partners in helping us develop this culture with the Are.na community.

There are two other people working with us that we haven't announced in an official way – [Damon Zucconi](https://www.are.na/damon-zucconi) (who is now leading engineering) and [Meg Miller](https://www.are.na/meg-miller) (who is the editor of the Are.na blog).
 
We also have two student fellows joining us this summer, [Anastasia Davydova Lewis](https://www.are.na/anastasia-davydova-lewis) and [Will Freudenheim](https://www.are.na/will-freudenheim). Anastasia joins us from Los Angeles where she is pursuing a degree in Digital Media at UCLA, and Will joins us from Middletown, Connecticut where he is pursuing a degree at Wesleyan University.
 
### Plans + Roadmap
In addition to being more transparent about our company structure, we are also making an effort to be more transparent about our upcoming product changes. Most of the Are.na platform is already open-source, but those who want a more high-level overview of what we plan to work on in the near-term can check out our [product roadmap](https://github.com/aredotna/ervell/projects/1).
 
### Mobile
This leads me to highlight one of our major projects for the summer: a native mobile app. This has been the number one most requested feature (and one we are most excited about ourselves). Our intention is not to create another app that you need to check compulsively, but to provide a tool to send information to Are.na at the moment you come across it in the world, as well as call up information that you previously saved.

In short, we now have the ability to make Are.na better in a shorter time-frame than we have previously. We have a more robust team and big plans for the summer, and we are excited to show you what we're working on.
