In almost every interview that exists online with [Margaret Lee](http://www.margaret-lee.com/), the one thing that undoubtedly gets brought up is the number of different jobs she holds. A widely exhibited artist in her own right, with past shows at the Hammer Museum and MoMA PS1, among many others, Margaret also works part-time as Cindy Sherman’s studio assistant. Since 2011, she and her husband Oliver Newton have run the gallery [47 Canal](http://47canal.us/main.php?1=&2=), where they’ve launched the careers of artists and friends like [Anicka Yi](http://47canal.us/main.php?1=ay&2=pics) and [Josh Kline](http://47canal.us/main.php?1=jk&2=pics). Now at 291 Grand Street, a couple of blocks away from its namesake beginnings, the gallery is located on the upper margins of New York City’s Community District 1 in lower manhattan.

Recently, Margaret has added one more thing to her plate: a founding member of the group [Art Against Displacement (AAD)](https://www.are.na/aad-chinatown-les), a coalition of art galleries, nonprofit institutions, and artists working to combat the displacement of residents and small businesses in Manhattan’s Chinatown and Lower East Side and affirms that gentrification is not an inevitable process inherent to urban development. The idea for the group sprung out of a town hall Margaret participated in last fall, where she was questioned about the ways in which opening up 47 Canal in Chinatown was contributing to the displacement of longtime residents of the neighborhood. Uneasy about the accusation, she called on her peers to mobilize immediately afterwards, using the formation of the group as a way to thoughtfully address these concerns and galvanize artists and galleries to be active in local politics and to stand by their neighbors. In a phone call last month, she talked about AAD’s conception and its freshly formed mission statement with both frankness and compassion, and a tenacity that feels, in talking to her, like what must be what fuels the many varied facets of her work.

**Meg Miller: What is Art Against Displacement (AAD) and why did you found it?**

Margaret Lee: I guess AAD at the moment isn’t quite anything because like any organization that wants to do good work, we don’t want to rush into things. Part of why this group has formed is galleries in Chinatown, New York, have been accused of being gentrifiers publicly. I was on a town hall [panel] with some grassroots organizations and was questioned ‘Why are you in Chinatown? Do you know who you’ve displaced by being here? Do you know that tenants in your neighborhood are being harassed? Do you know that tenants in your neighborhood are being displaced? Do you know that people are suffering around you?’

So on this panel, I had to confront that. While I think that I am part of the community here and I deserve to be in Chinatown, and I enjoy being in Chinatown, I did take it to heart that I was not paying the amount of attention at a local level as I should be as a business owner. So I apologized for not being more active and I asked how I could become more active. After that, we met with the Chinatown Art Brigade to discuss their [pledge](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/787505/original_ee6d2d093b1e2b495718ef29ebf2f6ee.jpg). The pledge has eight tenets that they suggest people in the neighborhood follow so that they minimize their impact on the community.

A few other people and I decided to start having meetings as business owners and artists in Chinatown and in the Lower East Side, talking about what we can do to collectively live by this pledge and to change this narrative of galleries and artists as gentrifiers to galleries and artists as allies. Are.na has been really helpful because our group is still in research mode. We’re still voting on certain things. As a group, we can’t have a website yet because we’re non-official, and we couldn’t just be on a Google listserv, in a way, because there’s so much information to share through the pledge. The first point of the pledge is “Get to know your neighbors, find out what people are doing in your neighborhood.’ As soon as you scratch the surface of what’s going on in the area, a million things come up. 

**I was excited to see you using Are.na in this way because I think it’s a good tool for organizing.**

Yeah, and sometimes people have already done the research. There was already a gentrification channel— someone had been tracking gentrification before me, and I love that I could just link to it and then continue to add to it. It’s nice to have all these multiple conversations because we live in a world where everything is overlapping, especially when it comes to politics. With Are.na, the way that you can connect things, it really works the way your mind would work. Like, ‘Oh, I really should connect [Chinatown City Councilperson] Margaret Chin to affordable housing,’ or Margaret Chin to Bill De Blasio, or Margaret Chin to Sheldon Silver. You can make these connections, and it takes a lot of the work out of having to write your own notes. 

**Right, and I think in terms of activism you are always working off of others who have already been working for years. Who are your allies in Chinatown specifically? Who are the people working toward a similar goal as you—and what is your relationship to those groups?**

We decided to first start with the existing community, which was our fellow artists and galleries. So that’s where our outreach has been. We’re trying to come up with what we can offer the community, rather than always asking the community to tell us what they need. Because it’s just more work for them. We didn’t want to create additional labor for grassroots organizations who are already strapped for time. 

At the beginning we did have to ask so we didn’t overstep any boundaries, but we realized how busy everyone is and that it would really come down to us just doing the research and learning on our own. You can ask someone to walk you through 30 years of Chinatown’s history and all the complications that exist within that. Or even the last two Margaret Chin terms. But it’s actually all there online so there’s no need to ask existing grassroots organizations. 

The easiest thing you can do is every day look up local websites like [the Lo-Down](http://www.thelodownny.com/) or [DNAinfo](https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/bridgeport-chinatown-mckinley-park) or a local Facebook group, or to sign up for your local representative's website and get updates. As we get updates I want everyone to upload them to Are.na to share with the group so that we’re sharing the responsibility of paying attention and doing the research, and then it's all organized in these channels. 

To me that’s a real first sign that you are doing the work. It’s not just going to a protest and holding a sign and never following up on anything. But continuing to make it a daily practice to check up on your neighborhood. I couldn’t think of any other platform that allows that to be done so easily and with such transparency, because when you add a block it’s attributed to you. So it’s also tracked, and shows who’s doing the work and who’s not. Not to call anyone out, but I think it’s important to keep a record of that. 

**In terms of doing the work and being a part of your community, there’s this Angela Davis quote that I wrote down for you about the importance of affected community members being leaders in the ‘movement.’ It is: “Whenever you conceptualize social justice struggles, you will always defeat your own purposes if you cannot imagine the people around whom you are struggling as equal partners.” I’m curious how you are thinking about that, in terms of artists being allies for those most vulnerable to being displaced?**

This is the thing that is our challenge. It’s what we discuss at our meetings. In our [mission statement](https://www.are.na/aad-chinatown-les/aad-info) we talk about alleviating the burden for those who are most at risk for displacement, and that’s in terms of financial resources, time and space. Galleries in the neighborhood probably have at least more space than the people who are being displaced. So how do we open our spaces up to the community? One thing we want to do is host and pay for supplies for making posters before a rally to invite people to come to our space to make posters, and use our labor to make those posters.

Because our group isn’t fully formed yet, I don’t know how many people in the community have accepted us because we haven’t really done anything. These are all things that we’ve been working towards. We do not want to be separate from the community; we don’t want to have a separate conversation. We want to listen to what’s being said in our neighborhood and stand by our neighbors. 

To answer your question, it’s what we want to do and we’re actively trying to do so, but it doesn’t happen overnight.

**Can you talk a bit about the perception of galleries specifically being on the frontlines of gentrification?**

Unfortunately, it’s something that galleries don’t necessarily want to be associated with. But there is something about what galleries do in terms of adding aesthetic value to neighborhoods that want to not have that aesthetic, which has been co-opted by new architecture and development. I think that in the eyes of someone who isn’t familiar with the contemporary art world, if they see a space that used to be a bakery or hardware store or something that the community needed, and a gallery comes in and they strip it bare and it basically looks like an empty space—you know, galleries are known for being clean, sparse, cold. You put the windows in. If you don’t know what the art is or anything about it, it just looks like the renderings of the buildings that are coming in to replace the tenements that were once here, or to replace the housing projects. When I look at renderings of new developments that are all glass and steel and empty and modernist and minimal, I can see why people make that association. A lot of new condos look and feel like galleries. That’s just the aesthetic of the time. 

I don’t think galleries intend to be gentrifiers. I think people who own galleries—and I’m not saying all, but especially the small ones that tend to gravitate to places like Lower East Side or Chinatown or Bushwick—really believe in the power of art. We have these artists spaces that are free and open to the public and we believe in what we put on the walls, and we believe that it’s educational. And we believe that art saves lives. Especially in places that are more socioeconomically challenged.

I come from a very working class background. Art is something that saved my life. It broadened my imagination. It made me think more existed than this shit life I had to live where no one appreciated culture, and what was the value of creativity and the human spirit when people are just struggling to pay their bills? I didn’t see it as a luxury, I saw it as life. So it’s something I’ve always done as a dealer in terms of how I choose my artists and what I’m trying to show—to always have that audience in mind. To address a contemporary situation, our culture, and try to change people's perceptions of what is allowed in countering the establishment.

When I was asked why I was in Chinatown [at the town hall in December] I was like ‘Because I’m Asian, and I really like being around other Asian people.’ As someone who didn't get to grow up in an ethnic enclave, as someone who’s parents owned a bodega, when I see someone struggling as a small business owner in Chinatown, I know what that’s like. I know exactly what that’s like to not speak English, to come to a new country with no money and open a business. It feels very familiar to me and it comforts me. I couldn’t live with being seen as a gentrifier. Anything that I can do to counter that and show that I care and a lot of people in my community care...I know it seems like art doesn’t care because the media has spun a tale about how it’s all about commerce and money. Most of the galleries down here are working to counter that narrative, so it’s also really natural for us to counter the narrative that we are gentrifiers. 

We’re also not rich galleries. We don’t want Chinatown to be gentrified. We don’t want new condos in the neighborhood, because it makes our landlords raise our rents. So we will also be displaced with our community. We might as well stand with the community and fight the good fight knowing full well that this is New York City, there aren’t many protections. But as I’ve been getting involved, I met this City Council candidate Christopher Marte who’s great. In paying attention to what’s going on, we realized that there’s City Council election in September. That’s something personally I’ve been wanting to get involved with, because our current City Council person [Margaret Chin] is part of the problem. 

Gentrification isn’t just about galleries coming in and changing the aesthetic. It’s policy. It is our civic duty, not just as people who don’t want to be gentrifiers, but as citizens, to get involved in politics. To know who represents you and what they stand for. If they’re not transparent about what they stand for, then they have to go. This is something that has really excited me about learning about the neighborhood. To me this is the thing where I have the most hope in terms of any type of protection or change. We’re rooting for a candidate who’s fighting to rezone Chinatown and the Lower East Side to protect it from high rises. This is what stops displacement. This is what stops gentrification. 

I wouldn’t have come to any of this if I hadn’t been accused of being a gentrifier. As I’ve learned, very few people vote for City Council. Very few people know who their City Council person is, what they stand for, if they’re good, if they’re bad. In that regard, that’s been the most important in terms of standing with your neighbors, because only your neighbors can vote for City Council. 

**I like what you’re saying about the intersection of the art world, real estate, and local politics. That there is this weird interplay between the aesthetics of a gallery and commercial redevelopment, which is of course a big factor in gentrification—but the intention behind those galleries, by and large, is that they’re artists and gallery owners who believe in art and are ultimately bringing art into these neighborhoods. But there is sort of still this invisible curtain, right? Do you get a lot of people from the neighborhood, or do you feel there is a division?**

There is absolutely a division. At our first meeting we had a tenant organizer come speak with us through a translator and she was just like, ‘I don’t even know what you guys are. All I see is emptiness. You guys don’t sell anything that I might want. Your doors are open but it doesn’t seem inviting.’ So one of the pledge points is to have bilingual signage and bilingual press releases so that people at least know, if we write in Chinese, that we are an art gallery. The problem is art galleries and contemporary art is understood by so few. My parents still don’t understand what I do. They still after all these years do not understand what I do, and why I do it, and why my gallery is in a weird place. If they think a gallery they think of Gagosian, you know? They don’t understand this niche market I sort of love to exist within. 

One of the things that we’ve been talking about is working with public schools in the area to do outreach to bring kids in on field trips. It’s the cheapest field trip in the entire world. You walk down the street and maybe you pick three galleries, any shows that might be appropriate to children and might be easily accessible to them. We give them a tour and explain to them what artists are, what galleries are, when we’re open and that we’re free to the public. 

And it’s not just galleries. I just recruited someone into the group that owns a store called [Two Bridges Music](http://2bridgesnyc.net/) and it’s in this Chinatown shopping mall under the Manhattan Bridge. On its own his store is totally bilingual because the Chinatown mall is all Chinese businesses except for him. He said the people who spend the most time in his store are actually these kids whose parents are working within the mall. The kids normally would sit around the mall waiting for their parents to get off of work, but they’ve discovered that there’s this store that exists with books and records and two turntables, and they come in and listen to records. And they think it’s cool because they’ve never played with a record player before. You know, you’re talking about ten year olds.

Most of the galleries down here run at a loss if not break even. We’re not of the same tier [as places] making millions of dollars. So it’s hard for us to see ourselves as gentrifiers when we also don’t have the finances to protect ourselves. We’re in this to educate ourselves and because feeling like we’re cut off from our neighbors is a very depressing thought. I want our neighbors to come in. 

Some of the local groups are very happy to see us show up with protests and to bring signs and be present, and it meant a lot to them. That was sort of a bridge out to curiosity about us. ‘Who are you guys? You keep showing up to these meetings, why do you care?’ We care because we’re part of this community. It’s hard because when you go to these meetings you see what an uphill battle it is. There’s this Two Bridges Development—these developers have the right to build these giant high rises in front of and on top of these giant low income housing projects on the east side, and a lot of us in the group have been going to these meetings to listen to the neighborhood concerns. But the buildings are going to be built. There’s no stopping them. In New York these developers have the right to build and they will, they couldn’t care less what the community’s concerns are. 

**Right, they have to ask the community, in certain development projects at least, for feedback. But they don’t have to actually take it into consideration.**

Exactly. It’s not about demands and having demands met, it’s about due diligence. This is where politics comes into play. Margaret Chin could have passed the AAD’s rezoning plan, which could have limited building heights in our neighborhood. She refuses to do so. As our City Council person, she literally has the power to enact this rezoning plan that would protect the LES and Chinatown as one neighborhood, and she refuses to do so. She only wants to protect historic Chinatown, which is for tourists, you know, Mott and Canal and Mulberry. It’s a small area, not that many people live there. Chinatown has extended past historic Chinatown. Where we are is a little more vibrant than Mott and Canal. 

It all comes down to rezoning. If all of this is passed, it comes down to nothing. Beyond getting to know your neighbors, which is always a good thing, I don’t see what we can do. We have no real power. I don’t own real estate. I’m a renter. I’m a commercial renter, which means i have no protections. Residential renters, at least for now, have rent regulation laws to protect them. 

<iframe class="arena-iframe" width="100%" height="2090" src="https://www.are.na/aad-chinatown-les/chinatown-working-group-rezoning-plan/embed"></iframe>

**So as far as your power as citizens, and as Margaret Chin’s constituents, what are you working on now to pass the rezoning plan?**

Well me personally, I’ve given up on Margaret Chin. It’s an election year, I want her to go. She’s said she won’t pass the rezoning plan, so I don’t see any reason to support her. Whereas Christopher Marte says that he does support the rezoning plan. He’s facing a very powerful incumbent who is funded by a real estate super PAC. [Margaret Chin] has a shit ton of money, and she’s well connected within New York City politics. I don’t know if he can win. 

If he doesn’t win, I don’t know what we’ll do. There are other things like translation [of signage], but to me they’re also bandaids, like plugging up a dam that’s about to burst. Then it's a matter of we’re going to do our best while we’re in the neighborhood. But we’re getting a condo catty-cornered to our gallery. That doesn’t bode well for anyone who wants to stay in their building. It’s a daily fight. 

**I want to touch on the racialized aspect of these things that you’re fighting against. I’m thinking about racial inequity and how it’s rooted in and prodded along by the design of our cities—both in a physical, built environment and also within the way our systems are designed to disadvantage some and benefit others. There was something I was reading from the writer [Nikole Hannah-Jones](http://nikolehannahjones.com/), who writes a lot about racial segregation in housing and schools, that sums it up nicely. It was about how people who call things like [aspects of the Fair Housing Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/opinion/ben-carsons-warped-view-of-housing.html), for instance, “social engineering” are neglecting the fact that things like redlining and redistricting and other practices that have lead to segregated cities are also by design. In your opinion, what do you think is the importance of art in dismantling some of those systems and reversing that racial inequality?**

I’m probably the only gallery in New York, in America, whose program is majority minority. I myself am not white. Therefore I’m not going to push a white supremacist agenda in upholding whiteness over anything else. I very much look for voices that speak to me. A lot of the artist that we show are first-generation Asian American, so this is why I’d be very excited to work with schools in the neighborhood to tell kids that this is possible. Your immigrant parents might not understand this, and you might not understand this, but you need to understand that this world is yours to own as well. 

You see cities like New York, which are highly desirable, being segregated because poor people are being displaced from areas like Chinatown and Lower East Side and being replaced by richer, more affluent, and generally, but not always, white people. This idea of whitewashing neighborhoods— unfortunately this is a truth and a reality that we have to witness. I don’t support Bill De Blasio anymore, because I don’t think he’s taking care of the housing prices in New York. I think his affordable housing plans are bullshit. People need to address what low-income housing means, and not fake-affordable housing. I have other people saying ‘He’s trying to create a sanctuary city and no one else is saying that, so who else are you going to support who will create a sanctuary city?’ But I don’t want to live in a sanctuary city that has kicked out the poor and people of color to create a sanctuary city for the affluent and mostly white. 

I do think art has the power to do that. When you affirm that people of color have voices, and there is a place for them to share those voices, and their voices will be heard and honored, this is what continues the fight. If we continue to ignore voices of color and continue to uphold whiteness as a pinnacle of art and culture, no one will continue to fight for these voices. 

Artists have a lot of unique things to say. They are born to say things what people generally don't think of. I think that’s what makes a great artist a great artist, that very unique perspective. Just doing the work to make sure that artists of color get the same platform as white artists, if more galleries in the world did that without this form of tokenism—you know, just one isn’t good enough.
