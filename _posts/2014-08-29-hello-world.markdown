###TLDR;
- We have already started development on our new isomorphic javascript client, Ervell.
- ([More][isomorphic-links] on isomorphic javascript)
- Ervell uses Artsy's [Ezel][ezel] boilerplate
- [Ezel][ezel] is easier to learn after looking at Artsy's [force-public][force-public] repo.
- Goals for Ervell
  - lightweight
  - responsive
  - push "collective file system" concept (channels nested under user, user lands on their own content initially)
  - be seo friendly
  - easier and more straightforward way to connect blocks to different channels
  - encourage exploration
  - blocks and channels are "starred", people are followed. "star" provides a method of saving content to look at later as well as providing a way to give positive feedback
  - more open to different display modes
  - better more natural display of user <-> block interaction (i.e. "morgan added this to cypherpunk, charles: '++++', charles starred this")
